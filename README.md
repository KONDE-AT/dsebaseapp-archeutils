# dsebaseapp-archeutils
utility module to ease the creation of ARCHE-RDF

This modules tries to ease the curation effort needed to describe a dataset of XML/TEI documents managed by a dsebaseapp as an ARCHE-RDF.
Its main idea is to reuse as much existing metadata as possible and avoid any potential data duplication.
The module consits of three main parts
* an XQuery module named `archeutils.xql`
* several API endpoints for serialising ARCHE-RDF data
* a single configuration file for project/resource specific data `data/meta/arche_constants.rdf`

Whereas the first two parts are generic and therefore provided as reusable module, the configuration file needs to customized for each dsebaseapp-project and is therefore NOT included in this module.

## install

* add this repo as submodule to your dsebaseapp project
* create a document `data/meta/arche_constants.rdf`

## archeutils.xql

The XQuery module named `archeutils.xql` exposes several variables needed to create an ARCHE-RDF fetched from
* the application structure
*  `data/meta/arche_constants.rdf`

## API-Endpoints

The main entry point is the API-Endpoint `archeutils/ids.xql` which returns a json with the following structure:

```json
{
    "arche_constants": "http://127.0.1.1:8080/exist/apps/thun/archeutils/dump-arche-cols.xql",

        "mimetype": "application/xml"
        }
    ]
}
```

* `arche_constants` points to the `archeutils/dump-arche-cols.xql` endpoint which returns ARCHE-MD serialized in RDF/XML by calling `archeutils:dump_collections($cols)` 
* each object in the `ids` array represents an XML/TEI resource which should be ingested into arche. The `md` key points to an resource specific archeutils endpoint `archeutils/md.xql?id={id/doc-name of the resource to ingest}`. The ARCHE-MD is generated by `archeutils/md.xql` which basically calls `archeutils:populate_tei_resource`

### params

* `limit={random-string}` list only 10 items, useful for testing the response of the endpoint as well as the actual ingest
* `custom_parent=true` use this if you'll have a custom collection structure (see more below)

## data/meta/arche_constants.rdf

(Ab)uses [repo-schema](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/repo-schema) to provide project specific data. E.g. [thun-data/meta/arche_constants.rdf](https://github.com/KONDE-AT/thun-data/blob/master/meta/arche_constants.rdf)

in `arche_constants.rdf` you can basically set three types of MD

1. Hand-made or literal MD. This is needed for project specific information, like project-descriptions, defining project-related agents (like e.g. PIs or funding bodies
2. Constants for either all collections/resources or dedicated collections/resources
3. dynamic md-properties derived from the actual XML/TEI Documents. For this you'll need to provide a mapping using Xpath.

### Xpath mapping

* the element name matches an arche-schema property
* the `@type` value can either be
  * `literal` -> the evaluated xpath expression becomes the `text()` of the element
  * `literal_no_lang` -> the evaluated xpath expression becomes the `text()` of the element but no default lang-attribute will be set
  * `no_eval` the `text()` will be copied into the arche-element (no need for this actually, as you can set constants on resource level anyway...)
  * `date` -> the elment get typed as date via `rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"`
  * `resource` -> the evaluated xpath expression is set as value for an `@rdf:resource`
  * `resource_many` -> in case the evaluated xpath expression returns a sequence, than for each item in the sequence, a new element (i.e. rdf-triple) is created

### custom parents

Sometimes the default eXist/dsebaseapp collection structure is not feasable for ARCHE. To circumvent this, you can pass a `&custom-parent=true` URL-param to the `ids.xql` endpoint. This will avoid the default behaviour of adding the default `isPartOf` triple to any XML/TEI (which is the ARCHE-ID of its collection) but using the value defined in `arche_constants.rdf`
BUT be aware that you'll need to provide the ARCHE-MD for those custom collections yourself and you'll need to be able to generate the matching IDs through XPATH (or custom xquery functions) called in `arche_constants.rdf`, e.g. something like:
```xml
<acdh:isPartOf type="resource">concat($item/@xml:base, '/',  substring-before($item//tei:title[@type="iso-date"]/text(), '-'))</acdh:isPartOf>
```
